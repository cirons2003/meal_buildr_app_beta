## A Problem to Solve
- I began thinking about this project in August 2023. As a D1 Collegiate Athlete, I noticed that despite its importance for performace on and off the field,
nutrition was not being emphasised to the same level as things like training, sleep, and hyrdation.
- Part of this, I believed, was caused by an inconvenient system that discouraged athletes from meeting with team dieticians.
- After lots of thinking, and gathering of feedback from my peers, I set out to create a better way for dieticians and athletes to interact.
- This solution, was started and scrapped many times before arriving upon the current prototype.  
  
## Mealbuildr comes into the Picture 
In my experience, 2 core problems plague the relationship of athletes and dieticians:
1) It is difficult to accurately recall and articulate eating habits precisely enough to get exceptional feedback during in person meetings.
2) Meeting in person limits the frequency and speed of feedback, and existing mobile solutions require too much effort from the athletes.

Mealbuildr Aims to Solve these by:
1) Delivering a focused and intuitive mobile experience, that enables real time feedback on diet related questions... lowering the barrier of communication between parties
2) Minimizing the overhead for the athlete. Requiring only 10 seconds per meal to maintain in depth logging of eating habits
3) Avoiding the innacurate calculations of existing nutrition apps, by letting registered dieticians provide feedback instead

## How long until Mealbuildr becomes a reality?
- Despite the misleading repository name, we are currently in the alpha stages, gaining feedback from a select group of test users before moving forward with a beta release. 
- We hope to be available for download by March 2025!
- Our alpha stage web platform is active at www.mealbuildr.com (Use team code 092835) -- Please contact ci7229@princeton.edu if interested in trying out the mobile (athlete) version!
